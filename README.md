Scandi Challenge - Instagram Clone


My application has as a main goal be a carousell component that work either to web application and mobile application. 
I build this based on the Instagram time line Slide componente. Bassically I rebuild that component. I have done the stories 
component too, but not with all the functionalities that the orginal has. 

For this, I used react.js, javascript, styled components and CSS.  

To run this application you have just to: 
  
  1. You have to install the npm package manager on your machine 
  2. Clone my repository in any folder you want; 
  3. Find in folder; 
  4. Run npm i; 
  5. Run npm start; 
  5. Access localhost:3000
  
I hope you like it :)
